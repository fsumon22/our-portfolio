   <p> While being online 24/7 is not always great, the list of ways that you can entertain yourself through the web is practically endless. On top of social media sites, there are also tons of funny blogs to read when you're bored. To put it in perspective: everyone reading this article has probably heard of The Oatmeal, Fail Blog, or The Onion at least once. However, one thing all these websites have in common is that they are immensely popular, and need little introduction. A lot of them also rely on images instead of text in order to give you a laugh
